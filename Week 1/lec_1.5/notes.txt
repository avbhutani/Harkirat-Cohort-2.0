- callbacks
- event loop, callback queue,call stack and webapi's

// Analogy about JS

Interesting thing to note here is that, the human brain is also single threaded.
but it can either context switch between tasks or it can delegate the task to someone else.
and whenver it is free, it can receive the task from another person.


Just like this, JS also, can perform one task at a time, but it can also,
context switch between tasks, and delegate the tasks to different web APIs or so,
so overall it can also do multiple tasks at once.



use this for deeper understanding of the JS architecture.

4 things, callstack, webapi's, event loop and callback queue.

all the actions that will be done by the webapi's gets pushed back into the callback queue and
then whenever the thread is free, then the callback queue takes over to the call stack.
