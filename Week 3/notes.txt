Consider a middleware as the precheck thing that exist in real world system,
maybe you are told to fill a form first to enter, check your id or maybe anything,
so anything that requires a precheck, requires a middleware.

2 things mainly are validated from the input
- If the user is authenticated or not, i.e, logged in or not.
- If the user has passed valid parameters for accessing the API. (New Learning)
These are the most important scenarios where a middleware is used.
